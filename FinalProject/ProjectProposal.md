## Project Title: Crop Yield Analysis


## Abstract: 

The goal of this project is to develop a web map using R or Tableau to visualize crop yields in Iowa over time and identify factors that impact production such as soil quality and weather patterns. The project will use data analysis techniques to explore the correlation between crop yields and factors such as soil quality, weather patterns, and crop management practices. By creating a web map that displays crop yields across different counties in Iowa over time, the project aims to identify trends and patterns that could help farmers optimize their crop management practices. The project will also incorporate remote sensing technologies to monitor plant growth and health, as well as weather patterns, to predict pest and disease outbreaks and determine when and how much water to apply to different areas of the field.
