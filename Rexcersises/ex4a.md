# This is my Exercise 4a file.
Let's create two plots using a built-in dataset in R called mtcars. This dataset contains information on various car models, including their miles per gallon (mpg), horsepower, and other variables. We will create a scatterplot of mpg vs. horsepower, and a barplot of the number of cylinders in each car model.

## Here are the steps to create these plots:
